That post described some ideas I was thinking about for a package that would allow people to design surveys using markdown and R. But the package didn't exist yet, it was just an idea. \n\nWell, I have good news: **the package now exists!** \n\nIn this post, I'm going to show you a quick overview of the {surveydown} R package for making markdown-based surveys.\n\n# What is surveydown?\n\nIf you've never used surveydown before, the video on [this page]() offers a 5 minute overview that you might find helpful.\n\n[surveydown](https://jhelvy.github.io/surveydown/) is a flexible platform for making surveys in `<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" role=\"img\" viewBox=\"0 0 581 512\" style=\"height:1em;width:1.13em;vertical-align:-0.125em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;font-size:inherit;fill:currentColor;overflow:visible;position:relative;\"><path d=\"M581 226.6C581 119.1 450.9 32 290.5 32S0 119.1 0 226.6C0 322.4 103.3 402 239.4 418.1V480h99.1v-61.5c24.3-2.7 47.6-7.4 69.4-13.9L448 480h112l-67.4-113.7c54.5-35.4 88.4-84.9 88.4-139.7zm-466.8 14.5c0-73.5 98.9-133 220.8-133s211.9 40.7 211.9 133c0 50.1-26.5 85-70.3 106.4-2.4-1.6-4.7-2.9-6.4-3.7-10.2-5.2-27.8-10.5-27.8-10.5s86.6-6.4 86.6-92.7-90.6-87.9-90.6-87.9h-199V361c-74.1-21.5-125.2-67.1-125.2-119.9zm225.1 38.3v-55.6c57.8 0 87.8-6.8 87.8 27.3 0 36.5-38.2 28.3-87.8 28.3zm-.9 72.5H365c10.8 0 18.9 11.7 24 19.2-16.1 1.9-33 2.8-50.6 2.9v-22.1z\"/></svg>`{=html} using three open source technologies:\n[Quarto](https://quarto.org/), [shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/), and\n[supabase](https://supabase.com/).\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"technologies.png\" width=600>\n</center>\n<br>\n\nThe basic concept is this:\n\n1.  Design your survey as a [Quarto shiny\n    document](https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/interactivity/shiny-r.html)\n    using markdown and R code.\n2.  Render your doc into a [shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) app that can\n    be hosted online and sent to respondents.\n3.  Store your survey responses in a [supabase](https://supabase.com/)\n    database.\n\nThe package is still in development, but you can already use it to create surveys. \n\n# Getting started \n\nAfter getting everything [installed](https://jhelvy.github.io/surveydown/articles/installation.html), we recommend starting with a template survey project. You can create one with the following R command:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsurveydown::sd_create_survey(\"path/to/folder\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `\"path/to/folder\"` is the path to where you want the template to be created. Once created, you'll see the following files / folders:\n\n```\nexample.qmd\n_extensions\nexample.Rproj\n```\n\nThe only file you will need to edit is the `example.qmd` file. This is the main survey file that you will edit and customize for your survey. The `example.Rproj` is just a project file, which I recommend opening to edit your `example.qmd` file in RStudio (if you're using it). Finally, the `_extensions` folder contains the [surveydown Quarto extension](https://github.com/jhelvy/surveydown-ext) needed to make everything work. You can safely ignore this folder - just know that it's needed to make everything work.\n\nIf you have the example open, you can click the \"Run document\" button (in RStudio) or in your terminal run `quarto serve example.qmd`. Either approach should render the example survey into a shiny app that you can preview in a browser. Don't worry just yet about setting up your database or making the survey live - for now, we're going to focus on designing the survey and running it locally to preview it. The example survey should look like this:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"example.png\" width=700>\n</center>\n\n# A new way to design surveys\n\nIn surveydown, your entire survey is designed using markdown and R code in a single Quarto document. There is no GUI or drag-and-drop interface - simply write plain text (markdown and R code) and boom - you have a survey! \n\nThe [{surveydown} package](https://jhelvy.github.io/surveydown/) provides a set of functions that allow you to define the survey content and control logic. Each function starts with `sd_` to make it easy to identify.\n\nTo edit your survey, you can add text using markdown formatting, or in RStudio you can edit with the visual editor, which inserts the markdown code for you. Survey questions are defined in R code chunks with a `sd_question()` function from the {surveydown} package. Pages are created using fences, with navigation handled with the `sd_next()` function. \n\nOnce all of the survey content is defined (pages, text, images, questions, etc.), you can modify the control logic in the server code chunk (the last code chunk at the bottom of the .qmd file) with the `sd_config()` function. Finally, in the same server code chunk you can define the database configuration with the `sd_database()` function to store the survey response data. \n\nWe'll get to all of this step-by-step.\n\n## Adding pages\n\nIn surveydown, pages are delineated using \"fences\", like this:\n\n```\n::: {#welcome .sd-page}\n\nPage 1 content here\n\n:::\n\n::: {#page2 .sd-page}\n\nPage 2 content here\n\n:::\n\n```\n\nAs you can see, we use three colon symbols `:::`, called a \"fence\", to mark the start and end of pages. This notation is commonly used in Quarto for a variety of use cases, like defining [subfigures](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html#subfigures) in images.\n\n\nIn the starting fence, you need to define a page name (e.g. `welcome` and `page2` in the example above) and you need to define the class as `.sd-page`. Then anything you put between the page fences will appear on that page. \n\nTo navigate to the next page, you need to insert a `sd_next()` function call inside a code chunk, like this: \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n````{.cell-code}\n```{{r}}\nsd_next(next_page = 'page2')\n```\n````\n:::\n\n\nThe above code chunk will create a \"Next\" button that goes on to page 2 that looks like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<button id=\"next-page2\" type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-default action-button\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\" onclick=\"Shiny.setInputValue(&#39;next_page&#39;, &#39;page2&#39;);\">Next</button>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou would need to place the code chunk in between the `:::` fences of the `welcome` page in order to have a \"Next\" button that goes on to page 2. You can also send the user to other pages by just changing the `next_page` argument. Finally, you can also change the label of the button by changing the `label` argument, like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n````{.cell-code}\n```{{r}}\nsd_next(next_page = 'page2', label = 'Next page')\n```\n````\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<button id=\"next-page2\" type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-default action-button\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\" onclick=\"Shiny.setInputValue(&#39;next_page&#39;, &#39;page2&#39;);\">Next page</button>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Adding questions\n\nEvery survey question is created using the `sd_question()` function inside a code chunk. The question type is defined by the `type` argument. For example, to add a multiple choice question, you could insert the following code chunk:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n````{.cell-code}\n```{{r}}\nsd_question(\n  type  = 'mc',\n  id    = 'penguins',\n  label = \"Which is your favorite type of penguin?\",\n  option = c(\n    'Adélie'    = 'adelie',\n    'Chinstrap' = 'chinstrap',\n    'Gentoo'    = 'gentoo'\n  )\n)\n```\n````\n:::\n\n\nThe above code chunk will create a mutliple choice question that looks like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div id=\"container- penguins\" data-question-id=\"penguins\" data-required=\"false\" class=\"question-container\">\n<div id=\"penguins\" style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"form-group shiny-input-radiogroup shiny-input-container\" role=\"radiogroup\" aria-labelledby=\"penguins-label\">\n<label class=\"control-label\" id=\"penguins-label\" for=\"penguins\"><p>Which is your favorite type of penguin?</p>\n</label>\n<div class=\"shiny-options-group\">\n<div class=\"radio\">\n<label>\n<input type=\"radio\" name=\"penguins\" value=\"adelie\"/>\n<span>Adélie</span>\n</label>\n</div>\n<div class=\"radio\">\n<label>\n<input type=\"radio\" name=\"penguins\" value=\"chinstrap\"/>\n<span>Chinstrap</span>\n</label>\n</div>\n<div class=\"radio\">\n<label>\n<input type=\"radio\" name=\"penguins\" value=\"gentoo\"/>\n<span>Gentoo</span>\n</label>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe `sd_question()` function can also be used to create [other question types](https://jhelvy.github.io/surveydown/articles/question_types.html), like text input, select drop down choices, and more. \n\nThe function has many other arguments for customizing the look and feel of the question. The `required` argument can be used to make a question required or optional, e.g., `required = TRUE`.\n\n# Why?\n\nOpen source \nFree \nOwn your data\nEase of editing - skip to page, etc\nVersion control \nReproducible \n\n# How we built",
