In the first three weeks of the Trump regime, we have witnessed what an "America First" agenda is going to look like, and to absolutely no surprise at all, it looks remarkably similar to the plans laid out in [Project 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_2025). What most are not yet fully understanding about these policies is that, in addition to the complete domestic chaos and suffering they will inflict upon Americans, they are steamrolling us to the end the era of U.S. global hegemony.

Recognize first that the name "America First" is utter bullshit, just like renaming the Gulf of Mexico is utter bullshit. In general, if you're unsure about what any of these policies is going to do, a good rule of thumb is that it will do the exact opposite of it's name. For example, the [Executive Order](https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/removing-gender-ideology-and-restoring-eeocs-role-protecting-women-workplace) on "Protecting Women in the Workplace" will most certainly make the workplace much more dangerous for women.

Policy names aside, when you look closely at what is being *done*, the implications are almost certainly going to diminish U.S. global power. Many believe that hegemony is maintained by having the biggest and most powerful military, and military might is certainly important. The strength of a modern military, however, should not measured by its ability to wage war but rather its ability to *maintain peace*, enabling the stability that is necessary for long-term economic and social progress. For generations now, some of the most significant roles the U.S. military has played are to 1) protect shipping lanes to maintain safe, reliable, and affordable global trade, 2) support aid missions to support those struck by disaster, and 3) defend democracy and human rights in nations around the world exposed to abuse. It is impossible to put a number on the "soft power" that these kinds of actions provide the U.S., but it suffices to say that the benefits to the U.S. far outweigh the costs. It is obviously not cost-less - these programs (and the U.S. military) are expensive, but they have enabled the U.S. to become the richest nation on the planet.

Every "America First" action happening now is directly undermining this world order. Placing irrational and arbitrarily steep tariffs on our strongest allies and trading partners changes the calculus. The rest of the world is quickly realizing that the U.S. is no longer a partner they can trust. Global firms will divest from the U.S. and send their investments to friendlier markets. People will boycott U.S. goods (as [Canadians are doing in droves](https://vancouversun.com/news/opinion-farewell-america-pete-mcmartin) now), and inflation driven by the import taxes that Americans will be forced to pay will soar. Once our trade relationships are destroyed, building them back again can take generations; you can't use your military to force nations to become friendly trade partners. Other nations will form new trade arrangements to bolster the loss of access to U.S. markets, cutting out and isolating the U.S. And of course, export-oriented businesses in the U.S. will find steep retaliatory penalties on their goods, leaving U.S. exporters with increasingly fewer markets. Those businesses will go under, unemployment will rise, and we will find ourselves in a deep recession from which recovery will be exceedingly hard because, well, the federal government that usually provides important supports during financial downturns is being dismantled.

But perhaps the most significant long-term damage will be the loss of *people*. The career federal civil service workers who have supported the U.S. through multiple administrations are being illegally fired in mass. Entire agencies mandated into existence by Congress are being erased from existence, and along with them the countless benefits those programs bring to stability and economic prowess in the U.S.

But it's not just the people here at home that we will lose. For generations, the dream of all the best minds in the world has been to immigrate to the U.S., not only because the U.S. is where the best ideas can be freely pursued, but also because the U.S. federal government invests billions of dollars supporting a powerful research enterprise that is the envy of the world. No longer. The unprecedented engine of innovation that established the U.S. as the technological leader in nearly every domain since WWII is now being completely (and and many cases irreversibly) severed by shadow president Musk, who is illegally cutting off Congressionally-mandated funding across nearly all U.S. agencies. The research enabled by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, and countless other U.S. institutions has been a fountain of scientific and technological breakthroughs that ensured the best ideas in the world originate here. The U.S. has largely been insulated from technological surprise since Sputnik because of the sheer scientific and technological might these institutions engender. Now they are all under assault, being single-handedly dissolved by Elon Musk and his cadre of teenage hackers.

The long-term impacts will be profound. Medicine, engineering, automotive, computation, aviation - with federal funding for research in these fields being illegally cut off, U.S. leadership in these areas will fall, and the researchers who drive innovation in these fields will relocate to places more that continue to fund their research. Even if funding is restored, it is clear that the U.S. is no longer a nation that supports Academic freedom; the regime has already released lists of words that cannot be used in federally-funded research. The effective banning of science in any field sends a chilling message to *all* scientists: be careful what you study, and be careful what you say. Any finding the regime finds too inconvenient could mean the end of your career. Science cannot be conducted in such an environment.

Of course, countless law suits have been filed against all of these measures. Judges are bravely ruling against the regime, standing up for law and exerting their constitutionally-granted power to check the executive. Now the real tests will begin. If Trump chooses to ignore these rulings, not only would those actions be illegal and unconstitutional, they will mark the end of constitutional order in the U.S.

What will replace the era of U.S. hegemony? This is perhaps the greatest uncertainty right now. Without a doubt, China is being made more powerful daily under the Trump regime, especially if they choose to step in to fill the aid relief efforts that the U.S. is abruptly abandoning. Russia has been engaged in a resource-consuming war in Ukraine, though it seems their power will soon be restored as Trump is all too willing to abandon Ukraine and give Russia everything it desires. The E.U. in turn isn't yet sure what role it wants to play, and an emboldened Russia under Trump will even further weaken it's global position.

But one thing is certain: history paints a pretty clear pictures of how Americans feel about tyrants. The MAGA cult wanted a king, and now they have a pretend one, enshrined by the Supreme Court's ruling on presidential immunity. But despite what powers Trump thinks he has, real power in the United States is ultimately held by the people. Every individual American makes a decision each day about the kind of world they want to live in, and that includes every American serving in the armed forces. The inevitable consequences wrought by co-president Trump and Musk's destruction of the federal government won't immediately be felt in full force, but they will be felt soon enough. The next disaster to strike will lay bare how much the federal civil service does to maintain stability, both in the U.S. and abroad. The next hurricane that isn't forecasted because NOAA was dissolved, or the next attack on our homeland because the CIA was purged, or the next economic recession brought on by Trump's trade war...whatever it is, when the people have had enough, the majority of Americans will see this regime for what it is. Our elected officials have a limited window of time to act and put an end to this unconstitutional behavior. If they don't step in, the people will. *Sic semper tyrannis*.
