On December 1, 2021, I had the honor of moderating the Industry Studies Association (ISA) webinar on the future of batteries for electric vehicles, as part of its ongoing [webinar series](https://www.industrystudies.org/isa-webinar-series) on industrial policy. You can watch the recording below.

**About the webinar**:

The auto industry is on the cusp of its greatest transformation in more than a century, shifting from internal combustion engines to electric motors powered by lithium-ion batteries. China, which already plays an important role in global auto supply chains, has been the first mover in this transformation, sparking concerns in the United States and elsewhere. This session will explore the United States’ proposed response to this challenge and its profound links to both long-run economic prosperity and the future of the planet.
