I am a PhD candidate in Biostatistics at the [University of Toronto](https://www.dlsph.utoronto.ca/division/biostatistics/), where I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Wei Xu](https://www.dlsph.utoronto.ca/faculty-profile/xu-wei/) and Prof. [Linbo Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/linbowangpku/home). I am also a DSI Doctoral Student fellow and a CANSSI STAGE trainee. My research interest is in causal inference, statistical genetics and genomics, with applications to health‑related data. 

Before beginning my PhD, I worked as a research associate in the Division of Biostatistics at the University of Toronto, collaborating closely with clinicians from Princess Margaret Hospital and Mount Sinai Hospital. There, I contributed to both statistical methodological development and applied studies—particularly in inflammatory bowel disease and lung cancer related data. Along the way, I found my interest in causal inference and identied some critical research gaps, ultimately motivated my doctoral studies.

Outside of research, I enjoy photography, tennis, and swimming. Most recently, I served as the official photographer for CSSC 2025 in Saskatoon.
