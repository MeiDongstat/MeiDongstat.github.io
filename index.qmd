### Welcome to my personal website!

I am a researcher, engineer, choice modeler, [`r make_icon("fab fa-r-project")`](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) enthusiast, musician, swing dancer, and an Assistant Professor at George Washington University in the [Department of Engineering Management and Systems Engineering](http://emse.seas.gwu.edu/). I study technological change, with a focus on accelerating the transition to environmentally sustainable and energy-saving technologies.
