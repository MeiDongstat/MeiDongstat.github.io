I am a PhD candiate in Biostatistics at the [University of Toronto](https://www.dlsph.utoronto.ca/division/biostatistics/), where I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Wei Xu](https://www.dlsph.utoronto.ca/faculty-profile/xu-wei/) and Prof. [Linbo Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/linbowangpku/home). I am also a DSI Doctoral Student fellow and a CANSSI STAGE trainee. My research interest is in causal inference, statistical genetics and genomics, and their diverse applications in health related data. 

Before beginning my PhD, I worked as a research associate in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Toronto, collaborating closely with clinicians from Princess Margaret Hospital and Mount Sinai Hospital. There, I contributed to both methodological development and applied studies—particularly in inflammatory bowel disease and lung cancer. Along the way, I encountered critical gaps in Mendelian randomization methods, which ignited my passion for causal inference and ultimately led me to pursue doctoral research.

Outside of research, I enjoy photography, tennis, and swimming. I served as photographer for CSSC 2025 hosted in Saskatoon.
