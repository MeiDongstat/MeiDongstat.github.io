    "text": "I am a PhD candiate in Biostatistics at the University of Toronto, where I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. Wei Xu and Prof. Linbo Wang. I am also a DSI Doctoral Student fellow and a CANSSI STAGE trainee. My research interest is in causal inference, statistical genetics and genomics, with applications to health‑related data.\nBefore beginning my PhD, I worked as a research associate in the Division of Biostatistics at the University of Toronto, collaborating closely with clinicians from Princess Margaret Hospital and Mount Sinai Hospital. There, I contributed to both statistical methodological development and applied studies—particularly in inflammatory bowel disease and lung cancer related data. Along the way, I found my interest in causal inference and identied some critical research gaps, ultimately motivated my doctoral studies.\nOutside of research, I enjoy photography, tennis, and swimming. Most recently, I served as the official photographer for CSSC 2025 in Saskatoon."
